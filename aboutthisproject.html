    <h2>About this Project</h2>
    <p>This website was created, as in previous years, by the students of the Informatics Middle School as part of the practical training in the first months of the first semester.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>In the first weeks of the project stuff like;
      <ul class="cm">
        <li>color palette</li>
        <li>layout</li>
        <li>typography</li>
        <li>structure of the website</li>
      </ul> 
      <p>were conceptually planned by the students, and in the weeks leading up to the winter holidays, this concept was implemented using HTML and CSS.</p>
