  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Abdullah. I was born on September 1, 2008, in Istanbul and moved to Switzerland at the end of 2021.</p>
      <br>
    <p>Currently, I attend the Informatics Middle School in Bern and want to continue my education, especially in the field of application development.</p>
      <br>
    <p>Since childhood, I have been interested in anime, cycling, computers, and especially video games. Recently, I discovered that I also enjoy listening to music.</p>
      <br>
    <p>I don't want to talk about my hobbies here, as it could make the page a bit too long.</p>
      <br>
    <p>If you hover your mouse over the left side of the page, a menu will open that will take you to the pages about my hobbies.</p>
