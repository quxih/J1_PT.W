            <h1>Breaking Bad</h1>
            <p>A brilliant series that shows, from a different perspective, how a chemistry teacher father, initially driven by the desire to provide a comfortable life for his family, eventually succumbs to killing people and dealing drugs to satisfy his own ego, ultimately becoming a major drug lord. I sacrificed a lot of sleep to watch it back then. And as soon as I find the time, I plan to watch the spin-offs.</p>

            <h1>The Boys</h1>
            <p>Moving away from the conventional idea of good heroes and bad heroes, they show how heroes in the capitalist system are commercialized for the interests of a particular company and how disgusting they actually are. It's an interesting concept presented from a different perspective. I really enjoyed watching it.</p>

            <h1>Dexter</h1>
            <p>Dexter is a series about a killer who conducts blood analysis at crime scenes and tries to blend into everyday life, while also solving murders in Miami and killing other killers to satisfy his own urge to kill. It's an interesting series that strikes a good balance between Dexter's interactions in everyday life and the comedy aspect.</p>

            <h1>Arcane</h1>
            <p>A series that tells the story of two sisters who lost their parents in the war between two cities and then lost their stepfather, describing the paths they chose to live their lives, blending this with an amazing art style, story, music, and animation. For me, an Arcane LoL player, and millions of others, it's a series that will be hard to match.</p>
