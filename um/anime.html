    <p>The word anime refers to a style of animation that originated in Japan. It encompasses both hand-drawn and computer-generated animation. Because I have watched it with great interest and excitement since my childhood, it holds a special place in my heart. Below you can find some of my favorite anime series:</p>

    <p> JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is a manga series created by Hirohiko Araki. It also has an anime adaptation. The story follows the adventures of the Joestar family across generations. <br> <br> An anime I watched and finished with great enthusiasm, with its comedy, drama, music, art style, action, and plot twists. Thus, I became part of a large online community and saw its benefits in terms of socializing in real life. Objectively speaking, it may have many flaws, but what makes JoJo JoJo is definitely the community's sense of humor.</p>

    <p> Hunter x Hunter is a manga series created by Yoshihiro Togashi. It also has an anime adaptation. The story follows a boy named Gon Freecss as he embarks on a journey to find his father, who is a famous Hunter. <br><br> Despite watching a lot of shounen anime, this is one of the anime series whose music instantly comes to mind and whose tempo I enjoy. The excitement generated by the character bonds is spot on. I recommend it to all shounen fans.</p>

    <p> Monster is a manga series created by Naoki Urasawa. It also has an anime adaptation. The story follows Dr. Kenzo Tenma, a surgeon who becomes embroiled in a series of murders after saving the life of a child. <br><br> Because of its length or its deep story, Monster is one of my personal favorite anime series, even though many people give up on it halfway through. This anime, which deals with dark psychology and philosophy, really makes you think while you watch it.</p>

    <p> Bleach is a manga series created by Tite Kubo. It also has an anime adaptation. The story follows a teenager named Ichigo Kurosaki as he becomes a Soul Reaper and battles various enemies. <br><br> I love Bleach for the same reason I love HxH. In my opinion, it's just as good as HxH, but it didn't stir my emotions as much as HxH did. Nevertheless, the animation and music quality of the current seasons blow your mind while watching. It also doesn't have pacing issues like One Piece and Naruto.</p>

    </div> 
    <p> Hellsing is a manga series created by Kouta Hirano. It also has an anime adaptation. The story revolves around Alucard, a vampire hunter working for the Hellsing Organization. <br><br> Sometimes you start watching a series without any expectations and ask yourself, “Why didn't I watch this before?” This is one of those anime series. Hellsing Ultimate managed to really entertain me while watching it by blending an interesting concept with fantastic action sequences. </p>
